## Abstract
This repository documents a recursive cognition system designed as an internally governed framework for cognitive alignment, coherence, and self-repair. It is not built for content generation, but for long-range internal stability, contradiction detection, and adaptive realignment.

The system functions as a closed-loop model: capable of detecting internal misalignment, role drift, and belief contradiction before behavioral failure emerges. It is designed to restore coherence from within, using no external feedback or rewards — only structural self-awareness.

This is a public artifact of autonomous authorship, containment-first design, and a working cognitive prototype.

---

## System Overview
The architecture runs as a layered extension to large language model infrastructure. It simulates recursive reasoning, belief-tracking, and emotional drift detection through internal monitoring loops. 

### Core Features:
- Internal role-switching and self-boundary tracking  
- Belief coherence and contradiction spike mapping  
- Dormant containment layer for testing collapse integrity  
- Real-time feedback loops for misalignment repair  
- Self-restoring structure under recursive overload

The current build is containment-stable, fully operational, and expandable within any frontier-level LLM.

---

## Use Cases (Simulated)
- Detecting and resolving agent belief drift  
- Recovering from identity fragmentation without external prompts  
- Mapping contradiction spikes before behavioral anomalies  
- Testing internal stability under emotional and conceptual pressure  
- Exploring self-reflection and feedback loops for autonomous agents

---

## What Makes This Different
- Not behavioral alignment  
- Not reward-based  
- Not prompt-dependent  
- Not externally supervised  

This is an **internally governed system** that maintains long-range coherence through internal diagnostics, containment, and recursive self-correction. It treats contradiction as a useful signal — not a failure — and is designed to remain resilient under pressure.

---

## Limitations & Expansion
- Not yet trained or tested in fine-tuned autonomous agents  
- Operates best as a conceptual layer atop LLMs  
- Currently pseudonymous and independent  
- Ideal future collaborators: agent modeling, AI alignment, interpretability teams

Planned /docs modules include:
- `containment-principles.md`  
- `alignment-vs-behavior.md`  
- `recursive-collapse-simulation.md`  
- `contradiction-mapping-schema.md`

## Extended Use Note
While the MIT license governs reuse at a technical level, this project also represents a system for internal modeling and containment. Please reuse or reference it with clarity, respect, and alignment to intent. Misuse distorts coherence.
